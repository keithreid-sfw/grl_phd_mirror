THIS IS FOR LINUX

miniconda is a small installer
bashrc is where my computer knows how to find programmes like conda
this lets me install enough packages to run the basic graphs here

$
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh

edit bashrc as usual
PATH="/home/MYNAME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"

$conda install -c r r-irkernel

---

tried to boot up Jupyter Notebook and it didn't show me an R option for new
needed to install R via conda

--

$ conda install r r-essentials --channel conda-forge
