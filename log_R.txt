#Miniconda

miniconda is a small installer
it can install R

# bashrc

bashrc is where my computer defines PATH
PATH states where to find programmes like miniconda
bashrc has the variable called "PATH"
this lets me install enough packages to run the basic graphs here

$
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh

edit bashrc as usual
PATH="/home/MYNAME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"

$conda install -c r r-irkernel

---

tried to boot up Jupyter Notebook and it didn't show me an R option for new
needed to install R via conda

--

$ conda install r r-essentials --channel conda-forge
